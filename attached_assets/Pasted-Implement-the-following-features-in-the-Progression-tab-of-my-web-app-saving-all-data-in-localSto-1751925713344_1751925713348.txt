Implement the following features in the “Progression” tab of my web app, saving all data in localStorage in a clean and consistent way.
Ensure that all calculations dynamically update whenever the user changes their current weight or any other relevant input.
Also include a water tracking functionality that compares how much water the user has already consumed today versus the recommended amount.
Save both inputs and results clearly, and display feedback messages about progress.

🚀 Features to Implement in Progression Tab
🔷 General Notes:
All calculations must automatically recalculate when user updates their weight, activity, or other inputs.

Save user goal: lose weight, gain weight, or maintain weight.

Show both numerical results and a short interpretation/message for each metric.

Track the amount of water the user logs per day and compare to calculated target.

Data is stored only in localStorage under clear keys.

Include a “Reset Progression” button to clear the progression data.

When the user reloads the page, load the last saved values into the forms and update the results.

Show validation and friendly error messages if inputs are invalid.

1️⃣ Water Intake Calculator & Tracker
Ask the user:

Weight (kg)

Activity level (sedentary, moderate, active)

Goal

Calculate recommended daily water:

Base: 35ml × weight (kg)

If activity = moderate → +500ml

If activity = active → +1000ml

If goal = lose → +500ml

Allow the user to log how much water they’ve already consumed today.

Compare logged water vs. recommended and display message (e.g., “You’ve reached 70% of your daily goal.”).

Save in localStorage:

js
Copy
Edit
localStorage.setItem("waterIntake", JSON.stringify({
  weight: 70,
  activity: "moderate",
  goal: "lose",
  recommendedMl: 3000,
  loggedMlToday: 1500,
  lastUpdated: "2025-07-07"
}));
2️⃣ Daily Calories Recommendation
Ask the user:

Height (cm)

Weight (kg)

Age

Sex (male/female)

Activity level

Goal

Calculate BMI:
weight / (height/100)^2

Calculate maintenance calories using Mifflin-St Jeor formula:

Men: BMR = 10×weight + 6.25×height − 5×age + 5

Women: BMR = 10×weight + 6.25×height − 5×age − 161

Adjust for activity & goal as before.

Save in localStorage:

js
Copy
Edit
localStorage.setItem("dailyCalories", JSON.stringify({
  weight: 70,
  height: 175,
  age: 30,
  sex: "male",
  activity: "active",
  goal: "maintain",
  BMI: 22.86,
  recommendedCalories: 2500,
  lastUpdated: "2025-07-07"
}));
3️⃣ Waist-to-Hip Ratio & Body Fat
Ask the user:

Waist (cm)

Hip (cm)

Neck (cm)

Height (cm)

Sex

Calculate:

Waist-to-hip ratio: waist / hip

Body fat % using US Navy method:

Men:
BF% = 495 / (1.0324 − 0.19077×log10(waist−neck) + 0.15456×log10(height)) − 450

Women:
BF% = 495 / (1.29579 − 0.35004×log10(waist+hip−neck) + 0.221×log10(height)) − 450

Save in localStorage:

js
Copy
Edit
localStorage.setItem("bodyComposition", JSON.stringify({
  waist: 80,
  hip: 95,
  neck: 38,
  height: 175,
  sex: "male",
  waistToHipRatio: 0.84,
  bodyFatPercentage: 18.5,
  lastUpdated: "2025-07-07"
}));
🔷 Optional UI/UX Suggestions:
✅ Inputs should prefill from localStorage if data exists.
✅ Every time the user updates their weight, activity, or goal → automatically recalculate everything and update results + localStorage.
✅ Water tracker resets logged amount at midnight (optional: detect day change).
✅ Progress bars: show % of water goal reached and % of calorie goal.
✅ Show interpretation messages like:

“Your BMI is within the normal range.”

“Your waist-to-hip ratio suggests a low risk.”

“You’ve already drunk 70% of your recommended water today.”

📌 Summary of LocalStorage Keys:
Key	What it stores
waterIntake	weight, activity, goal, recommendedMl, loggedMlToday
dailyCalories	all user metrics + BMI + calories
bodyComposition	all measurements + ratios
